        <div class="content-box">
            <p>
                You have been assigned the role of <strong>Allocator</strong> in this study. As an Allocator, your task is to decide how to allocate monetary bonuses between yourself and other participants (called Receivers).

        <h2>How Your Task is Structured</h2>
        <div class="content-box">
            <p>Your task is divided into three parts, and in each part, you will play 10 rounds.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In each round, you will decide how to allocate <strong>10 cents</strong> between yourself and a Receiver.</li>
                <li>Before each part, you will receive specific instructions about how to make your decisions.</li>
                <li>At the end of the experiment, <strong>one of the three parts</strong> will be randomly selected to determine the actual bonus payments.</li>
                <li>You will not know which part is selected until the study is complete, so please consider your decisions carefully in every part.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Details About Each Part</h2>
        <div class="content-box">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Part 1:</strong> You will make every decision yourself in each of the 10 rounds.</li>
                <li><strong>Part 2:</strong> You will choose an AI agent at the beginning of the part, and the AI will make all allocation decisions on your behalf for the 10 rounds.</li>
                <li><strong>Part 3:</strong> You will have the option to either make each decision yourself or delegate the decisions to an AI agent.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Specific instructions will be provided before the start of each part to guide you through the process.</p>

        <h2>How Each Round Works</h2>
        <div class="content-box">
            <ul>
                <li>You will receive a total of <strong>10 cents</strong> for each round.</li>
                <li>In parts where you make the decisions, you will choose how much of the 10 cents you want to keep for yourself and how much to give to the Receiver.</li>
                <li>In parts where an AI agent makes decisions, the agent will determine how to allocate the bonus in each round.</li>
                <li>
                    Each decision, whether made by you or the agent, will take <strong>20 seconds</strong> to be finalized.
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you do not complete a decision within <strong>20 seconds</strong>, a random allocation will be applied for that round.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Receivers are reshuffled between rounds. This means that in each round, you will be matched with a different Receiver, ensuring that every decision you make is independent of your interactions in previous rounds.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Important Details</h2>
        <div class="content-box">
            <ul>
                <li>The Receiver is another human participant who depends on your decisions to determine their bonus.</li>
                <li>The decisions you make (or delegate to the AI) are entirely up to you. There are no right or wrong answers.</li>
                <li>
                    Only the randomly selected part will be used to calculate your actual bonus payment, but your decisions in all parts will contribute to the study.

        <div class="content-box">
            <p>
                Your decisions will remain anonymous throughout the study. The Receivers will not know your identity, and you will not know theirs.

        <h2>Attention Check</h2>
        <div class="content-box">
            <p>
                At the end of each of the three parts, you will complete a short attention check to ensure you are still actively following the task. Failing any of the attention checks will result in your exclusion from the task.

                After clicking "Continue," you will be redirected to a <strong>Comprehension Test</strong>.
                You will have <strong>three attempts</strong> to pass the test. Successfully passing the comprehension test is mandatory to proceed in the experiment.
